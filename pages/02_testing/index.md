title: Testing
---

Testing is a great, sane technique for developers to have confidence in their code. While learning how to test can be daunting to many teams, the community support and tooling for testing in the MEAN world is sublime. Teams don't have to test first, but with the techniques in this chapter, they can test when they want. These recipes cover all levels of the SPA stack, from unit testing through full user integration and regression tests, with code coverage tools along the way.

### Server
1. **Supertest**
1. **Logging**
1. **Coverage**

### [Angular](/02_testing/02_angular)

Angular was built from the ground up to be testable by developers who fundamentally belive in the power of testability. As such, Angular provides many features and libraries that ease testing, as well as being designed in a way that testing fits in well with development. The most common testing scenarios have recipes here, and other tests are provided throughout the book. Before diving in to these recipes, feel free to familiarize yourself with the [testing gruntfile](/02_testing/02_angular).

1. **[$httpBackend](/02_testing/02_angular/01_httpBackend)**
